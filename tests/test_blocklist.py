"""Blocklist CI guard — fails if internal names or personal paths leak into the repo.

Run on every CI build (and pre-commit locally). Scans *every tracked text
file* for strings that would identify the author's private projects,
machines, or filesystem layout. Keep the blocklist here in this file (not
in .gitignore); it's a safety net, not a secret.

Two rules make this guard trustworthy:

1. **Deny by default.** Coverage comes from ``git ls-files``, not from a
   list of directories. A directory allowlist silently exempts every new
   top-level directory added later, which is how the sibling repo came to
   ship absolute local paths from two directories nobody had added to the
   scan list.
2. **The detector must not leak.** Banned tokens are assembled from
   fragments at import time so the private strings never appear as
   literals in this public file. Read ``_token`` calls as the joined
   string; don't "tidy" them back into single literals.

Add banned strings to BANNED / BANNED_WORDS below. Keep the lists narrow —
false positives waste contributor time. ALLOW_PATHS exempts files where a
match has a legitimate non-leak meaning.
